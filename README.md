A Rails Engine for the [Waste Exemptions](https://github.com/DEFRA/waste-exemptions) digital service.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you already have:

- Ruby 2.4.2
- [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) â€“ for installing Ruby gems
- PostgreSql

## Mounting the engine

Add the engine to your Gemfile:

```
gem "waste_exemptions_engine",
    git: "https://github.com/DEFRA/waste-exemptions-engine"
```

Install it with `bundle install`.

Then mount the engine in your routes.rb file:

```
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount WasteExemptionsEngine::Engine => "/"
end
```

The engine should now be mounted at the root of your project. You can change `"/"` to a different route if you'd prefer it to be in a subdirectory.

## Installation

You don't need to do this if you're just mounting the engine without making any changes.

However, if you want to edit the engine, you'll have to install it locally.

Clone the repo and drop into the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DEFRA/waste-exemptions-engine.git && cd waste-exemptions-engine
```

Then install the dependencies with `bundle install`.

## Testing the engine

The engine is mounted in a dummy Rails 4 app (in /spec/dummy) so we can properly test its behaviour.

The test suite is written in RSpec.

To run all the tests, use:

`bundle exec rspec`
