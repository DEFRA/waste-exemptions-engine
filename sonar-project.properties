# Because rails generates a number of files, and SonarCloud has no rails and
# ruby intelligence we have found we have to specify what should be covered.
# If we don't SonarCloud will do things like take the raw coverage data from
# simplecov, compare that to all files ion the repo, and score 0 for all the
# files we don't actually need to test. This severly deflates our scores and
# means it is not consistent with our previous reporting tool CodeClimate.
